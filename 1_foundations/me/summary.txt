My name is Olalekan Hammed (Stephen). Iâ€™m a program manager, data analyst, and software developer with a passion for building smart systems that solve real-world problems. Originally from Nigeria, I now call Indianapolis home.
I drink liquor occasionally, but I'm not big on food at all. I dont like diary, because my doctor says i have high cholesterol - I won't take the recommended medicine, wester medica kinda scares me,nperhaps that because I grew in Africa with herbs.
